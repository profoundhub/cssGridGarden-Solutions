## GRID GARDEN

Uh oh, looks like weeds are growing in the corner of your garden. Use grid-column-start to poison them. Note that the weeds start at the 5th vertical grid line.

#garden {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 20% 20% 20% 20% 20%;
  grid-template-rows: 20% 20% 20% 20% 20%;
}

#poison {

grid-template-columns:
}
